1. Word Puzzle 

This problem was asked by Coursera.

Given a 2D board of characters and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

For example, given the following board:

[
  ['A','B','C','I'],
  ['S','I','C','S'],
  ['E','D','E','E']
]

Input Format :
Input consists of a single string in UPPER CASE.

Output Format : 
Output consists of a single line stating "True" - if the board contains the input string or "False" - if it doesn't contain the input string.

Note : The file/class should be named as "ArrayWordPuzzle" with appropriate file extension.

2. Longest consecutive number sequence

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example, given [100, 4, 99, 1, 3, 2, 200], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. 
Print its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Input Format :
First line of the input is an integer N which is the size of the array.
Next N lines of input contains a single integer each representing elements of the array arr[]

Single integer which is the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Constraints : 
2 <= N <= 100
0 <= arr[i] <= 10000

3. Pogo Jump 1

This problem was asked by Google.

You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions:

 (x,y) to
    (x+1, y),
    (x - 1, y),
    (x, y+1),
    (x, y-1),
    (x-1, y-1),
    (x+1,y+1),
    (x-1,y+1),
    (x+1,y-1)
	
You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

Example:

Input: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]
Output: 2
Move from (0, 0) to (1, 1) in 1 step(diagonal) and then from (1, 1) to (1, 2) in 1 step (rightwards)

Input Format :
First line of the input is an integer N which is the number of points.
Next N lines of input contains 2 integers each separated by a space representing x and y of each point.

Output Format : 
Single integer which is the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Constraints : 
1 <= N <= 100
0 <= x,y 

Note : The file/class should be named as "PogoJumpMinimum" with appropriate file extension.

Input 1 : 
	3
	0 0
	1 1
	1 2
Output 1 :
	2
	
Input 2 :
	4
	4 6
	1 2
	4 5
	10 12
Output 2 : 
	14
	
4. Pogo Jump 2

This problem was asked by Pinterest.

Given an integer list where each number represents the number of hops you can make, determine whether you can reach to the last index starting at index 0.

For example, [2, 0, 1, 0] returns True while [1, 1, 0, 1] returns False.

Input Format :
First line of the input is an integer N which is the number of points.
Next N lines of input each contains an integer representing the possible distance of jump from that point.

Output Format : 
Single line - "True" if able to reach the end of the array / "False" if not able to reach the end of the array.

Constraints : 
1 <= N <= 100
0 <= arr[i] <= 10000
